# Welcome

This shold represent a personal blog of (in her heart) network engineer, that found their way towards Platform Engineering and automation.
At the very beginning, there may not be much of a content over here, but hoping over time to evolve it and talk about automation projects, thoughts and experiences about Platform Engineering, Operations, Agile.

In a completely paralel universe, one may also expect content regarding some of my favourite sports and activities (skiing, tennis, MTB/Gravel biking, mountaineering, travel), and much more.

Cheers for now and see you in a new commit-id :).
